# AutoConnect

AutoConnect automates sending LinkedIn connection requests without spamming.

Without spamming? well, in order not to reach maximum allowed requests, we need to withdraw unapproved requests. But then the tool will spam them again with the next time it runs.

This tool, keeps a log of sent requests and automatically checks it to make sure no request is sent more than once.

## Security In Consideration

You don't need to disable 2FA on your account for this took to work.

Simply add your secret key to the `.env` file which you can find in your LinkedIn account preferences.
Next time it the script runs, it uses the build in OTP generator to log in.
